Cooper,

I just tried to access the webpage with the user ID and password and it let me in.  Please confirm that you are going to the webpage www.djinteractive.com.  Also, the user ID and password are case sensitive.

Thanks,
Laura

Laura,

I'm having trouble with this username/password combo.  
Can you test it for me?

Thanks,
Cooper
