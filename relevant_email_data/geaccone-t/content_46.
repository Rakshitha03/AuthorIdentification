We really don't want too many people at the meeting.  I am afraid the room will be overflowing.  Could you send Caroline and either Tony or Amy?

Thanks

I'll be on vacation.  IT will be well represented by our BUC and Amy/Tony.

This year we will be looking at the income statement on a functional basis rather than a legal entity basis.  As such, it is important the you and/or your functional unit coordinator (BUC) attend these meetings.  Your BUC should be meeting with you prior to these meetings to review your numbers.  We sent a planning calendar out last week which shows when these meetings are scheduled.  You do not need to attend the pre-meetings.  

Our first meeting with Stan for the first quarter is on Friday, February 23 at 3:30 in 49C2.

Please let me know if you did not receive the calendar or could not find it on the intranet.
