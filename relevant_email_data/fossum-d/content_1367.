There is another  approach.  We could have Mavrix submit a binding bid righ=
t now for the 60 mm/d and just flat out sell it to them.  That would send a=
 pretty strong signal to the market that we are serious about deadlines.  T=
he downside of that aggressive approach is that it would get us into the sa=
me mess that El Paso finally got themselves out of, with Amoco, Dynegy and =
the whole gang beating the crap out of us.  I'm not to fired up about this =
approach for that reason.  I'll give you a call Monday after I've picked ou=
r best regulatory brains on these issues.  DF
