Mark--anything you can do to give this guy a sense of what life is like at =
DOE would be great.  I'm not sure how seriously Dave is being considered fo=
r the DOE Dep. GC spot, but I know that Fred Fielding and Dick Wiley have d=
one some pushing on his behalf.  It may be that a call from you to someone =
out there might put him over the hump.  I'll leave that for you and he to d=
iscuss.  Thanks and good luck with your various adventures!  df
